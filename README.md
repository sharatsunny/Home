A game that was intended to be a simple first person horror unfortunately due to lack of funding, resources and other issues the game never got the chance to begin development. I worked as a programmer nonetheless for the game and created both simple and complex game mechanics as I was requested of so that the level designer could begin utilising it if necessary, I added in on the notes next to each mechanics the controls but the blueprints themselves are poorly commented as  was intending to update this project further myself later on.
